Nautilus: Nuclear Application UTILities and Useful Stuff (the acronym is up for debate)

Nautilus is part of the Cross-Cutting Applications Project (XCAP) at LANL.  It is a collection of
tools to support atomic and nuclear simulation codes, written in C++17.  The goal is to provide
useful pieces of code that can be shared by a variety of other codes.

If you need support or have a feature request, the best way to reach out to the team is to `open a
user issue in the Nautilus repository`__ or email `xcap-support@lanl.gov`_ using "Nautilus" in your
subject line.  The XCAP project lead is `Bobby Philip`_, and the Nautilus library is primarily
supported by `Brendan Krueger`_ and `Diego Lonardoni`_.
