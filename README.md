# Nautilus

**Nautilus**: **N**uclear **A**pplication **UTILities and **U**seful Stuff (the acronym is up for
debate)

Nautilus is part of the Cross-Cutting Applications Project (XCAP) at LANL.  It is a collection of
tools to support atomic and nuclear simulation codes, written in C++17.  The goal is to provide
useful pieces of code that can be shared by a variety of other codes.

If you need support or have a feature request, the best way to reach out to the team is to [open a
user issue in the Nautilus repository](https://re-git.lanl.gov/xcap/ec/nautilus/-/issues) or email
[xcap-support@lanl.gov](xcap-support@lanl.gov) using "Nautilus" in your subject line.  The XCAP
project lead is [Bobby Philip](bphilip@lanl.gov), and the Nautilus library is primarily supported
by [Brendan Krueger](bkkrueger@lanl.gov) and [Diego Lonardoni](lonardoni@lanl.gov).
